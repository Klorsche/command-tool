hashcat is the worldâ€™s fastest and most advanced password recovery utility, supporting five unique modes of attack for over 200 highly-optimized hashing algorithms. hashcat currently supports CPUs, GPUs, and other hardware accelerators on Linux, Windows, and OSX, and has facilities to help enable distributed password cracking.

*basic syntax*
```
hashcat -m HASHNUMBER -a METHOD FILETOCRACK [/path/to/wordlists/]
```

*Method* 
 - 0 - Dictionary Attack [need a wordlist]
 - 3 - Brute Force
